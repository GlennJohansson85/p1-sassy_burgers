### Features
#### Style
Strived for a clean and user-friendly interface by employing a dark-colored background complemented by vibrant pink titles. To enhance the visual appeal, I added a subtle white text-shadow effect to make the titles stand out. For the textual content within the website, I chose a more sophisticated font-family to ensure a mature and elegant appearance, avoiding any overly playful or childish elements.

To maintain a cohesive look, I applied a consistent outline in the same color as the navbar and footer to all images, providing a unified visual experience throughout the website. Additionally, I utilized gradient coloring for the "hr" element to infuse a touch of originality and visual interest into the design.
